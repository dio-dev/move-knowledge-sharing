## 1. Introduction to L1 Ecosystems

Layer 1 blockchain networks serve as the foundation of blockchain technology. Each ecosystem represents a different approach to solving fundamental blockchain challenges:
- Transaction processing
- State management
- Smart contract execution
- Asset handling

These differences create unique tradeoffs in terms of:
- Scalability
- Security
- Decentralization
- Developer experience

## 2. Types of L1 Networks

### Account-based Systems (e.g., Ethereum)
- Uses account balances and state changes
- Sequential transaction processing
- Smart contracts with global state
- Example: Traditional bank account model

### UTXO-based Systems (e.g., Bitcoin)
- Transaction output based
- Parallel transaction processing possible
- Limited smart contract capabilities
- Example: Physical cash model

### Parallel Execution Systems (e.g., Solana, Sui)
- Concurrent transaction processing
- Different approaches to state management
- Built for high throughput
- Example: Multiple cashiers serving customers simultaneously

## 3. CAIP-2 and Interoperability

### What is CAIP-2?
Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposal 2 provides standardized blockchain identifiers

### Why We Need It
- Enables cross-chain applications
- Simplifies wallet integrations
- Standardizes blockchain references
- Example format: "eip155:1" for Ethereum mainnet

### Benefits
- Consistent addressing across chains
- Easier integration development
- Better user experience
- Future-proof applications

## 4. Network Comparisons

### Solana vs EVM Networks

| Feature | Solana | EVM Networks |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Consensus | PoH + PoS | PoS/PoW |
| Programming | Rust | Solidity |
| Transaction Model | Parallel | Sequential |
| Block Time | Sub-second | Several seconds |
| State Management | Account-centric | Global state |

### Move-based Networks vs EVM

| Feature | Move-based | EVM Networks |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Language | Move | Solidity |
| Data Model | Object-centric | Account-based |
| Execution | Parallel | Sequential |
| Asset Handling | Native objects | Contract-based |
| Security Model | Resource-based | Guard-based |

## 5. Move Language Benefits

### Security Advantages

#### Resource Safety
- Resources cannot be copied or discarded
- Must be explicitly moved between storage locations
- Prevents reentrancy attacks by design

#### Type Safety
```move
struct Token has key, store {
    value: u64
}
```
- Linear type system
- Explicit resource management
- No null references

#### Attack Prevention
- Reentrancy: Prevented by design
- Double-spending: Impossible through resource system
- Integer overflow: Built-in checks
- Unauthorized access: Ability-based control

## 6. DAG-Based Architecture

### Traditional Blockchain
- Linear sequence of blocks
- Sequential transaction processing
- Limited throughput

### DAG Structure (Used in Sui)
- Multiple parallel paths
- Transactions can process simultaneously
- Only related transactions need ordering

### Benefits
- Higher throughput
- Lower latency
- Better scalability
- Independent transaction finality

### Challenges
- More complex implementation
- Sophisticated state management
- Advanced consensus requirements

---

## 7. Technical Deep Dives

### Aptos Implementation Details
- Rotating validator scheme
- Block-STM for parallel execution
- Flexible account model
- Key rotation capability
- Direct token ownership

### Sui Token Handling
- Object-based tokens
- Split and merge operations
- Direct ownership model
- Parallel processing
- Causal transaction ordering

### Account Models
- EVM: Separate contract/user accounts
- Aptos: Unified resource accounts
- Sui: Object-centric ownership
- Solana: Program-derived addresses
